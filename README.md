This repository contains the complete project for the L'Or√©al Datathon, where we developed an AI-driven system to identify and forecast emerging trends in the beauty industry from video content data.

Our solution moves beyond simple analytics to provide a forward-looking view of what's next in beauty.

# üìà Complete Data Pipeline Explanation: From Raw Video Data to Actionable Forecasts

This repository contains the `cleaned_data_pipeline.ipynb`, a sophisticated end-to-end data science project that transforms a raw dataset of video metadata into a powerful forecasting tool. The pipeline automatically discovers content trends, groups videos into niche topics, and builds robust time-series models to predict future upload volumes for each niche.

## üöÄ Core Features

-   **Automated Topic Discovery**: Leverages **Sentence Transformers** and **KMeans Clustering** to move beyond simple keyword analysis and understand the semantic *meaning* of video titles.
-   **Hierarchical Clustering**: First identifies broad content pillars (e.g., "Makeup Tutorials") and then drills down into specific sub-topics (e.g., "Eye Shadow Looks," "Foundation Reviews") for granular insights.
-   **Intelligent Data Correction**: Implements an automated reassignment module using **Cosine Similarity** to intelligently correct initial misclassifications, ensuring data quality and model accuracy.
-   **Robust Anomaly-Aware Forecasting**: Employs the **Holt-Winters** method with **Rolling Cross-Validation** to find the optimal forecasting model for each content niche, automatically detecting and correcting for statistical anomalies in the training data.

## üìä The Pipeline Explained

This pipeline is a multi-stage process where the output of one step becomes the input for the next, progressively refining the data to extract maximum value.

    end
```

### **Step 1: Data Ingestion & Preparation**
The pipeline kicks off by downloading the video dataset from Google Drive, unzipping it, and loading it into a Pandas DataFrame. The crucial `publishedAt` column is immediately converted to a datetime object, preparing it for time-series analysis.

### **Step 2: Macro-Topic Clustering**
To get a high-level view of the content, we first group videos into broad categories.
1.  **Text Embedding**: Video titles are converted into numerical vectors using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` Sentence Transformer model.
2.  **Optimal `k` Selection**: The **Elbow Method** is used to programmatically determine the ideal number of clusters, avoiding guesswork.
3.  **KMeans Clustering**: The KMeans algorithm assigns each video to a cluster.
4.  **Human-in-the-Loop**: The resulting clusters are given meaningful names (e.g., 'Educational Skincare & Wellness'), and irrelevant categories are filtered out.

### **Step 3: Micro-Topic Sub-Clustering**
With broad topics defined, we drill down to find more specific niches.
1.  **Domain-Specific Models**: For each macro-topic, a more specialized Sentence Transformer model (e.g., `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`) is used to generate highly nuanced embeddings.
2.  **Secondary Clustering**: The same Elbow Method + KMeans process is run *within* each macro-topic to create granular sub-clusters (e.g., `Hair Styling & Transformations_1`).

### **Step 4: Automated Cluster Refinement**
Initial clustering isn't always perfect. This step intelligently cleans up the results.
1.  **Problem Identification**: A "catch-all" cluster ('General Beauty') is identified as containing misclassified videos.
2.  **Similarity Search**: For each video in a "bad" subcluster, we calculate its **cosine similarity** against all videos in its target "correct" cluster.
3.  **Automated Reassignment**: The video is automatically moved to the most similar sub-cluster, ensuring our final groupings are logical and coherent.

### **Step 5: Time-Series Forecasting with Anomaly Detection**
The final, most powerful step is to predict the future.
1.  **Data Aggregation**: For each clean sub-cluster, a monthly time-series is created by counting the number of videos published.
2.  **Anomaly Handling**: Before training, an initial Holt-Winters model identifies and smooths statistical outliers (e.g., a sudden viral spike) to prevent them from skewing the underlying trend and seasonality.
3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: A **Rolling Cross-Validation** framework rigorously tests all combinations of Holt-Winters parameters (trend, seasonal type, seasonal period) by training on expanding windows of data and forecasting a 6-month horizon.
4.  **Best Model Selection**: The parameter set with the lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) across all validation windows is selected as the champion model for that sub-cluster.

## üèÅ Final Output

The pipeline concludes by generating the `forecasting_summary_df` DataFrame. This powerful summary table provides, for each content sub-cluster, the exact Holt-Winters parameters that yield the most accurate predictions and the expected forecast error (MAPE).

**Example Output:**

| subcluster | trend | seasonal | seasonal_periods | avg_mape |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Makeup Tutorials & Challenges_2 | add | mul | 12 | 14.35 |
| Hair Styling & Transformations_4 | mul | add | 6 | 18.92 |
| Educational Skincare & Wellness_0 | add | add | 10 | 21.05 |

This output delivers directly actionable intelligence, enabling stakeholders to understand the predictability and seasonality of every content niche identified by the pipeline.
